A replacement USB connector board for JBL's Flip 2 bluetooth speaker, using a Hirose ZX62D-B-5PA8(30) Micro B connector.

The board must have a thickness of 1 mm, otherwise it won't fit into the case of the speaker.

On the original board were two footprints, probably resistors, which were not placed.
