1. The PCB rendered with KiCad.
2. And the manufactured PCB. This is rev. 18/1, so D1 is missing and the pinout of Q1 is backwards.
3. The parts were populated and the PCB mounted in the casing. Ignore the LF356N.
4. The battery holder was mounted in the other half of the casing and wired to the PCB. Q1 was also fixed.
5. Done. The box fits nicely in one's hand.
